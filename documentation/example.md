# Here, you will find a description of the some of sample TSAK scripts

Nothing demonstrates system capabilities better, than a collection of the sample scripts and solutions. We are striving to bring as much examples, which demonstrates TSAK system, as possible. Most of those scripts are designed to be running in "exclusive run" mode, when they are passed as a value to a *-run* command line parameter.

## Basic scripts

This scripts is pretty much showing you the "Hello world" type of applications.
Script | Description
----|------------
[helloworld.script](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/newrelic-TSAK/blob/main/examples/run/helloworld.script) | A true HelloWorld script, also demonstrating that the values imported through configuration file, available from inside the TSAK script.
[log1.script](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/newrelic-TSAK/blob/main/examples/run/log1.script) | Demonstration of how you can send a messages to the TSAK logging.
## Network and SNMP scripts

## Data management and AI scripts
